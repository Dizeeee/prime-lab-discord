# Prime Lab Nights Discord Bot Example

This is a basic discord bot meant to introduce students to Node, npm, and Typescript.

## Setup

You need Node >=16.8 to run this example, (check your version with `node -v`) if you need to update, use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#about). Get the latest version of node with `nvm install stable`, and set node to use it with `nvm use stable`. Once you have that done, install packages the bot depends on by running `npm install` in the directory `package.json` is stored in. After that `npm start` will start the bot, and saving changes will restart the program.

## Next Steps

[discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome) provides great documentation with lots of examples, so it's definitely worthwhile to get used to reading it. If you're stuck on something though, just google it. There are tons of resources online on StackOverflow and blogs that will probably give you what you're looking for!

Have fun!
